# MASM Assembly Language Projects

Welcome to my MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) repository! This collection of projects reflects my personal learning and hands-on practice with x86 Assembly Language using MASM. It includes fundamental exercises and a complete implementation of the **Hangman Game**, showcasing structured programming techniques, string manipulation, user interaction, and control logic at a low level.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔧 `Code Files/`
This directory contains basic MASM practice programs. Each file demonstrates a specific concept in assembly language programming:

- `Add-Prog.asm` – Addition program using registers.
- `Array.asm` – Basic array operations.
- `atoz.asm` – ASCII character printing from A to Z.
- `CapitalToSmall.asm` – Case conversion from uppercase to lowercase.
- `CopyingArrays.asm` – Memory manipulation and array copying.
- `JumpCondition.asm` – Conditional jump demonstrations.
- `Loops.asm` – Looping constructs in Assembly.
- `Macros.asm` – Usage of macros in MASM.
- `NumberAddition.asm` – Integer addition using procedures.
- `Procedures.asm` – Subroutine demonstration.
- `SearchingChar.asm` – Character searching logic.
- `Sub-Prog.asm` – Modular sub-program structure.

### 🎮 `Hangman_Game/`
Contains the core logic of the Hangman game:

- `GameCode.asm` – Main execution logic of the Hangman game.

### 🧩 `Hangman-CodeSnipp/`
Code snippets and submodules used in the Hangman game:

- `CompleteGuess.asm` – Logic for handling complete guesses.
- `CompleteIncorrectG.asm` – Incorrect guess logic handling.
- `CorrectGuesses.asm` – Logic for tracking correct guesses.
- `GameReset.asm` – Game reset functionality.
- `IncorrectGuesses.asm` – Display and track incorrect guesses.
- `ReplayOption.asm` – Replay game option.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **personal practice ground** for learning Assembly language programming using MASM.
- A **reference for beginners** interested in understanding how high-level logic can be translated into low-level instructions.
- A **project showcase** of building a classic game (Hangman) using MASM.
